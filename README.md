# SCD_Hive_data_pipeline
# **incremental loading and merging using Hive and MySQL**

**PROBLEM:**

A company ABC receives the data about the purchase made on their website by customers on a daily basis. To streamline the data collection and analysis, the company wishes to load all the data on a relational database system so that it can be accessible easily. Also, they need to maintain the data which is up-to â€“date i.e if there is any change made in the purchase order, it must overwrite the previous data reflect in the database. 



**APPROACH:** 

We follow a step-by-step process in achieving the solution for the above-mentioned problem: 

1. Load the data from client's machine and create a table on MySQL. 
2. Load the data into Hive Table. 
3. Implement SCD-1 to keep the up-to-date data. 
4. Load the data back into MySQL. 
5. Create a backup table for reconciliation.
